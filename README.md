<h1 id="toc_0">Dirty Data Project - Codeclan</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1">Description</h2>

<p>This was our Week 4 project where we were given multiple very messy data sets and are tasked with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cleaning them up</li>
<li>Analysing the result by answering set questions</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_2">How I went about it</h2>

<p>80% of my time was spent cleaning the data. Using everything I had learned from the previous 3 weeks on the course. The most time consuming part of this was using regex to correct and distill down a horrible free text input &#39;Country&#39; column. </p>

<p>Beyond the cleaning the analysis itself was relatively straight forward and I&#39;m happy with the result. </p>
